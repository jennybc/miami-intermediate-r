Sticky note feedback
========================================================

Positives

  * ggplot session was really helpful! Thanks for create examples, using countries, GDP/capita, etc. For people from the social sciences (political science) is extremely helpful.
  * Both Jenny & Berny were great at summarizing the important bits of each topic and putting it into context.
  * Slow pace
  * Material and code, available online
  * sticky note system
  * thank you!
  * examples are great!
  * the succession of material was great. everything built up at a good pace.
  * learning about ggplot2 and plyr etc was awesome
  * RStudio
  * ggplot2
  * data aggregation
  * pipeline
  * help in ggplot ... before I was in pit of despair
  

Negatives

  * A few more pauses when a lot of typing is required, as I didn't always type it right the first time and got behind.
  * Please point to where we can find the selection or task, in addition to verbalizing. When you are new to a program, or method, you don't always know where to "find" things.
  * examples at the end w/ writing and reading tabular data; `write.table()` defaults to spaces, important to set delimiter to tab, so `read.table()` bring data back in (Jenny re-phrased)
  * would have liked non-traditional use of R, eg cluster analysis, qualitative analyses
  * provide as much code as scripts or test before class so both students and instructors spend less time typing and can just use cut and paste
  * maybe some background before the class could have been sent out ahead of time, just so we would have some sort of idea what would be covered
  * we spent almost a full day in total on Git / file management, which was interesting but I wanted 2 days on R. File management should be a separate session.
  
Negative that became a positive ... or at least neutral

  * version control / github stuff was neat to see but not my focus for being here ... I'll take that back, though, now that I see it in action
